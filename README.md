Sales Dashboard â€“ Power BI (DirectQuery) | SQL Server + SSMS

This project demonstrates the use of DirectQuery in Power BI to connect to and analyze real-time sales data from a SQL Server database:
  * Data Source: Connected to a SQL Server database (SSMS) using DirectQuery, leveraging SQL views, SELECT statements, and functions.
  * Data Cleaning: Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query, ensuring consistency and readiness for modeling.
  * Date Table: Generated a custom date table in Power Query to support date-based analysis.
  * Data Modeling: Structured data into a star schema for efficient relationship handling and better report performance.
  * Product Hierarchy: Designed a product hierarchy to enable seamless category-level drill-downs.
  * DAX Measures: Created a central measures table using DAX to calculate KPIs like total number of orders, total of amount due, and total amount for shipping.
  * Interactivity:
    - Enabled drill-down, drill-through, and tooltip pages for contextual detail.
    - Applied visual-level filters on specific charts to target user-relevant data views.
  * Dashboard: Developed a comprehensive interactive dashboard with slicers and visuals to support performance tracking and strategic decision-making.

This project highlights practical skills in SQL, data modeling, Power Query, DAX, and designing intuitive, business-ready dashboards in Power BI.
